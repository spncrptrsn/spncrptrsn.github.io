### Scripting a player-driven quest with varied solutions

For this quest, I started with this relatively simple premise, provided by Larian Studios as part of their scripting test: 

>Richard the mayor of the human village of Glenrock has a letter that needs to be delivered to his mistress Sabrina who is drinking away >in the tavern. In this letter he states his love for her and that he wants to leave his wife Jane to spend the rest of his life with >Sabrina. Sabrina is at the tavern drinking because she can't stand Jackson her husband who works as a grocer at the local grocery >store. Jackson has been suspecting Sabrina of cheating on him for quite a while now, he keeps track of her whereabouts in his diary. He >can't say anything to Sabrina about her misbehavior because she knows about his dark life before he came to Glenrock. On many occasions >she has threatened to tell Liam, the guard captain, Jackson's secrets in order to lock him away for good if he didn't stop being so >jealous and suspicious of her.

My take on Glenrock (outlined in full in [this chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/04bf2714-35b7-4376-a7ae-37b7e30ab1db/0#)) gave Richard and ulterior motive for presenting the player with this task. If the player follows mayor Richard and Sabrina's requests without deviating from them, they'll be framed for the murder of Liam, the captain of the guard.

I planned this less as a 'bad ending' and more as an 'uninquisitive ending.' Inquisitive players can begin to unravel the criminal conspiracy afoot in the town by learning that the tarot card reader in the town square is effectively the gatekeeper to the local drug trade. Interact with her without this knowledge and she'll gladly read your fortune:

This basic reading is fully functional, powered by a dialog tree that can give you different outcomes.
