### Scripting a player-driven quest with varied solutions

For this quest, I started with this relatively simple premise, provided by Larian Studios as part of their scripting test: 

>Richard the mayor of the human village of Glenrock has a letter that needs to be delivered to his mistress Sabrina who is drinking away >in the tavern. In this letter he states his love for her and that he wants to leave his wife Jane to spend the rest of his life with >Sabrina. Sabrina is at the tavern drinking because she can't stand Jackson her husband who works as a grocer at the local grocery >store. Jackson has been suspecting Sabrina of cheating on him for quite a while now, he keeps track of her whereabouts in his diary. He >can't say anything to Sabrina about her misbehavior because she knows about his dark life before he came to Glenrock. On many occasions >she has threatened to tell Liam, the guard captain, Jackson's secrets in order to lock him away for good if he didn't stop being so >jealous and suspicious of her.

I set my quest outside Arx to take advantage of all the relatively empty real estate, and the premise emerged from the context: In the battle for control of Arx, a band of magisters had made it past the bridge with a stash of source artifacts pilfered from the vault of the white robes. Most were felled by voidwoken, but at least one made it out alive and disguised himself among the pilgrims. Can you find out who it is and claim the treasures they stole for yourself?

The quest is introduced near the wreckage of the Lady Vengeance, where the magister who made it farthest from the carnage picked a very unfortunate place to stand. By this point the player is well-primed to activate Spirit Vision when they see a corpse, but there are other quest initiation paths for those who don't.

The player comes across a ghost standing next to a lootable corpse with an arm and a source gem inside. At this point there are four methods for getting journal entries providing the initial quest hook.

 * Convince a very sarcastic ghost to give up his compatriots to the person who just crushed him under a tree. Gain a journal entry detailing what he told you about his friends' last moments. Gain a journal entry about his reticence if you fail.
 * Failing that conversation check, consume his hand. Gain a journal entry from what you learn from his final memories. (With the option of confronting him about what you learned.)
 * Failing that conversation check, give up and consume his spirit for source. In his final moments he tries to mollify you by starting to stammer out what he knows. Gain a journal entry wondering what he was about to say.
 * Pick up the Source Orb and get a journal entry wondering what a magister was doing with a gem of pure source in his pocket. This last one can start the quest without using Spirit Vision, and missing the spirit entirely.
 
 Here's an example of how that encounter might play out:

Though all these paths will start the quest, the path that gets you the most information involves experiencing the flesh memory. If your party doesn't have an elf, the corpse taster is waiting for you by the abandoned wagons. Though even if you do have one, he may still have a useful recipe for Elven Bone Broth to provide later on.
