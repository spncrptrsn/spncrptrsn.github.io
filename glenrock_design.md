### Scripting a whodunnit where the witnesses are already dead

This quest is based around two of my favorite mechanics from D:OS 2: ghosts and flesh memoriesâ€”those accessible to Elves when they consume the limbs of the dead. If you were trying to solve a mystery in Rivellon, a ghost would still retain its subjectivity, and could potentially mislead you. Flesh memories don't lie, though, and I considered the dynamic between the two worth exploring.
