### Armor-Based Saving Throws

Divinity: Original Sin II ditches the D&D-inspired saving throw system for resisting ill effects you'll find in most CRPGs for a much simplified, easier to master armor system. Instead of a character rolling a d20 and adding their will modifier to resist confusion, they simply resist confusion if they have any magic armor left.

This has a plus side of being much clearer to users than Divinity: Original Sin's system, where a unit's Willpower or Bodybuilding score would determine their chance to resist a physical or magic effect. But one downside of this system is it reduces some of the excitement that comes from an RNG-based system: the high of making a low-chance roll to save a party member, the personal affront of getting hit by someone's 5% hail mary skill.

Armor-Based Saving Throws is my attempt to inject a little bit of XCOM into D:OS II. In forum posts during early access, a number of ideas were floated about what an RNG-based saving throw system might look like. While the traditionalists put forth one based on stat scores, like in the old D&D model, this would have thrown the baby out with the bathwater re: the game's current armor system. Not only would it have turned armor into a layer of abstraction on top of health, it would have added an unintuitive and clunky layer to combat, where users would have to right-click on units and view their stats to calculate a skill's chance to hit.

My solution was to turn a unit's percentage of remaining armor into their percentage chance to save against an ill-effect. Though adding in preview tooltips seemed beyond the possibilities of the editor...
