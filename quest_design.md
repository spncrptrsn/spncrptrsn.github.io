### Scripting a whodunnit where the witnesses are already dead

When brainstorming my first quest I first considered what areas were empty enough to easily fit new scenes and actors. I chose the outskirts of Arx. The mechanics I wanted to build on were two of my favorites from the main game: ghosts and bodypart memories. If you were trying to solve a mystery in this setting, a ghost, though severed from the mortal world, would still retain its subjectivity, and potentially mislead you. Bodyparts don't lie though. 

(This quest has yet to be published, but some important scenes and dialogues are included below--once the Talent solution came to me that project turned into a black hole of my modding time.)

What if you heard one thing from a ghost, suspected you were being lied to, and had the opportunity to test their word against the memories you discovered through Elven flesh consumption? When I first considered this, it was clear why bodily memories were never central to a questline--not every party is going to include an elf. But what if an enterprising elven NPC was willing to nibble on these parts for you, and impart to you the impressions for a nominal fee?

If there were bodies outside Arx, it would be a safe bet they'd be magisters or pilgrims. So the premise emerged from the context: in the battle for control of Arx, a band of magisters had made it past the bridge with a stash of source artifacts pilfered from the vault of the white-robes. Most were felled by voidwoken as they tried in vain to use these to defend themselves. At least one made it out alive and disguised himself among the pilgrims. Can you find out who it is and claim his stolen artifacts?

Not all were felled by voidwoken, though. One was crushed by a tree knocked over by a boat careening into the hillside on its way out of the hall of echoes.

At this stage the quest has one points of first discovery that cannot be missed: An area trigger that gives you a journal entry wondering what this magister was doing this far from Arx. Most players will likely learn more details at this stage through a number of method:

 * Seeing a corpse in a somewhat comical position, use spirit vision. Convince a very sarcastic ghost to give up his compatriots to the person who just crushed him with a boat. Gain a journal entry detailing what he told you about his friends' last moments. Gain a journal entry about his reticense if you fail.
 * Failing that conversation check, consume his hand. Gain a journal entry from what you learn from his final memories. (With the option of confronting him about what you learned. After he confronts you about eating his hand, of course.)
 * Failing that conversation check, give up and consume his spirit for source. In his final moments he tries to appease you. Gain a journal entry wondering what he meant.
 * Pick up the Source Orb and get a journal entry wondering what a magister was doing with a gem of pure source in his pocket. This can be done without using Spirit Vision, and missing the spirit entirely.
