### Scripting a whodunnit where the witnesses are already dead

This quest is based around two of my favorite mechanics from D:OS 2: ghosts and flesh memories—those accessible to Elves when they consume the flesh of the dead. If you were trying to solve a mystery in Rivellon, a ghost would still retain its subjectivity, and could potentially mislead you. Flesh memories don't lie, though. 

(This quest has yet to be published, but some early scenes and dialogues are included below.)

What if you heard one thing from a ghost, suspected you were being misled, and had the opportunity to test their word against the spirits own memories? When I first considered this, it was clear why Corpse Eater asides were never central to a quest—not every party is going to include an elf. But what if an enterprising elven NPC was willing to nibble on these parts for you, and tell you about the experience for a reasonable fee?

I set my quest outside Arx to take advantage of all the free real estate, and the premise emerged from the context. In the battle for control of Arx, a band of magisters had made it past the bridge with a stash of source artifacts pilfered from the vault of the white-robes. Most were felled by voidwoken, but at least one made it out alive and disguised himself among the pilgrims. Can you find out who it is and claim what they took from the vault?









Not all were felled by voidwoken, though. One was crushed by a tree knocked over by a boat careening into the hillside on its way out of the hall of echoes.

At this stage the quest has one points of first discovery that cannot be missed: An area trigger that gives you a journal entry wondering what this magister was doing this far from Arx. Most players will likely learn more details at this stage through a number of method:

 * Seeing a corpse in a somewhat comical position, use spirit vision. Convince a very sarcastic ghost to give up his compatriots to the person who just crushed him with a boat. Gain a journal entry detailing what he told you about his friends' last moments. Gain a journal entry about his reticense if you fail.
 * Failing that conversation check, consume his hand. Gain a journal entry from what you learn from his final memories. (With the option of confronting him about what you learned. After he confronts you about eating his hand, of course.)
 * Failing that conversation check, give up and consume his spirit for source. In his final moments he tries to appease you. Gain a journal entry wondering what he meant.
 * Pick up the Source Orb and get a journal entry wondering what a magister was doing with a gem of pure source in his pocket. This can be done without using Spirit Vision, and missing the spirit entirely.
 
 Here's an example of how that encounter might play out:

 Suppose you didn't have an elf in your party? As you make your way to Arx, another unmissable quest update occurs in the form of an NPC who accosts you.
