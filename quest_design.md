### Scripting a whodunnit where the witnesses are already dead

This quest is based around two of my favorite mechanics from D:OS 2: ghosts and flesh memories—those accessible to Elves when they consume the limbs of the dead. If you were trying to solve a mystery in Rivellon, a ghost would still retain its subjectivity, and could potentially mislead you. Flesh memories don't lie, though, and I considered the dynamic between the two worth exploring.

(This quest has yet to be published, but some early scenes and dialogues are included below.)

What if you heard one thing from a ghost, suspected you were being misled, and had the opportunity to test their word against the spirit'ss own memories? When I first considered this, it was clear why Corpse Eater asides were never central to a quest—not every party is going to include an elf. But what if an enterprising elven NPC was willing to nibble on these parts for you, and tell you about the experience for a reasonable fee? (Link to video in screenshot.)

I set my quest outside Arx to take advantage of all the relatively empty real estate, and the premise emerged from the context: In the battle for control of Arx, a band of magisters had made it past the bridge with a stash of source artifacts pilfered from the vault of the white robes. Most were felled by voidwoken, but at least one made it out alive and disguised himself among the pilgrims. Can you find out who it is and claim the treasures they stole for yourself?

The quest is introduced near the wreckage of the Lady Vengeance, where the magister who made it farthest from the carnage picked a very unfortunate place to stand. By this point the player is well-primed to activate Spirit Vision when they see a corpse, but there are other quest initiation paths for those who don't.

The player comes across a ghost standing next to a lootable corpse with an arm and a source gem inside. At this point there are four methods for getting journal entries providing the initial quest hook.

 * Convince a very sarcastic ghost to give up his compatriots to the person who just crushed him under a tree. Gain a journal entry detailing what he told you about his friends' last moments. Gain a journal entry about his reticence if you fail.
 * Failing that conversation check, consume his hand. Gain a journal entry from what you learn from his final memories. (With the option of confronting him about what you learned.)
 * Failing that conversation check, give up and consume his spirit for source. In his final moments he tries to appease you. Gain a journal entry wondering what he meant.
 * Pick up the Source Orb and get a journal entry wondering what a magister was doing with a gem of pure source in his pocket. This last one can be start the quest without using Spirit Vision, and missing the spirit entirely.
 
 Here's an example of how that encounter might play out:

If you don't have an elf in your party, you can find the corpse taster having set up shop by some abandoned wagons.
